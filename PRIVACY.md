## Overview

New Line Guide is a Chrome extension that displays a helpful guide "new line = shift + enter" above text input areas on ChatGPT and Claude websites. This privacy policy explains how the extension handles your data.

## Data Collection

**New Line Guide does NOT collect any personal data.**

### What data is stored locally:

The extension stores only two settings on your device:
- **Extension enabled/disabled** (true/false)
- **Debug logging enabled/disabled** (true/false)

These settings are stored using Chrome's built-in sync storage and are synced across your Chrome browsers if you're signed into Chrome.

### What data is NOT collected:

- ❌ Personal information (name, email, address, etc.)
- ❌ Browsing history
- ❌ What you type in text inputs
- ❌ Website content
- ❌ Location data
- ❌ Any other personal or sensitive information

## How the Extension Works

The extension:
1. Runs only on `chatgpt.com` and `claude.ai` websites
2. Detects text input areas on these pages
3. Displays a small guide above the input area
4. Stores your preference settings locally

## Third-Party Services

**New Line Guide does NOT use:**
- Analytics services
- Tracking scripts
- Third-party APIs
- External servers
- Advertisements

## Data Sharing

**Your data is never shared with anyone.** All settings stay on your device or sync through Chrome's built-in mechanism.

## Your Rights

- Disable the extension at any time from Chrome's extensions page
